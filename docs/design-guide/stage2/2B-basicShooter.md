## Shooter Mechanisms

The type of games where you may need to launch the game piece instead of placing it directly into the goal is very common in FRC. The height limits are significantly lower than one of the scoring regions, necessitating a mechanism to launch the game piece to score it. These goals are typically defined as the “high goal”, and is often paired with another scoring region within height limits (generally called the "low goal") that may provide an easier and more reliable way of scoring for many teams. 

This type of game can be seen in 2014, 2016, 2017, 2020, 2022, and 2024. 2018 and 2023 saw some small usage of shooters as well, but were mostly accomplished with mechanisms like elevators instead. Most games have you launch balls, but the fundamentals between ball shooters and shooters for non-spherical objects remain roughly the same.

The most common way of launching a gamepiece is with a flywheel shooter, though other methods exist (catapults and punchers).

[This video](https://youtu.be/QZKDnRvLhrA) is a good slow-motion look at how a ball gets propelled out of a shooter.

Other mechanism examples and deep dives for shooters can be found on the [ball shooters page](). The mechanism fundamentals page is yet to be made but will also be a helpful resource.


## Project

Reference [**this document**](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/8f093edaad44b5702e92ddd9/w/fefbb7a7af099fc237c1513a/e/84d7075719d34c35b3be9410) to copy the basic shooter in your own document.

### Concepts

(NOTE FOR DAVID: Remember that the purpose of this section is to explain the concepts behind the decisions that were made for the design of the ball shooter they're copying. Frame your explanations around that. Go through each concept and explain the decisions you're making based off of the gamepiece you're provided. "Because it's this way, I'm going with this, because of these reasons, otherwise you could do this." You can go into more general depth in design fundamentals.)

**Shooter Wheels**

Basic wheel choice

**Contact Time & Wheel Speed**

**Inertia**

**Spin**

**Motor & Ratio Choice**

**Friction & Efficiency**

**Indexing/Feeding**

Include storage of balls leading to the size of the shooter and indexing

**Hood Angle**

**General Design & Robustness**

Explain what makes the design simple and robust, and how to maintain rigidity in a structure like this.

### Master Sketch
(NOTE TO DAVID: Remember, brief tips/steps for these sections, they should know how to do the actual CAD but it's nice to have a more general checklist of what to do. Be a bit more thorough in master sketches since the master sketches for each mechanism will need different things. Check the OTB intake page for an example.)
