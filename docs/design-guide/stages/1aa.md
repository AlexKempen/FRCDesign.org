# Stage 1A: Theory

As you probably know, CAD is a tool used to design parts digitally before they are manufactured. Most of our documentation will focus on FRC-specific CAD practice. However, to get started with Onshape, it’s important to understand some basic theory.

| Consider a basic 3D object, such as this cylinder. Every object you design in Onshape starts with a 2D sketch within a window called a part studio. Sketches are used to define a 2D profile, that is then manipulated with features. These features transform the 2D sketch, one change at a time, into a 3D object - by “extruding” or pulling the profile into 3D, revolving it around an axis, or by other methods.
