# Stage 2

Welcome to stage 2! In this stage, you'll focus primarily on learning how to optimize your CAD to be more parametric and work on your own projects to get design reviews and feedback. Stage 2, or the intermediate stage is a lot more open ended, and can be seen more as a "choose your own adventure"
