## Gearbox 1
This first gearbox introduces you to some basic ideas. By the end of this you should be able to design your first gearbox and be introduced to some of the tools used. 

Some concepts:
Motors:
Motors spin and power mechanisms

Gearing:
Gears are used to both transfer torque from one shaft to another, as well as through gearing increase the amount of torque. The pitch diameter is the diameter of the gear where if two pitch diameters are touching, allows the gears to perfectly mesh.

The main calculation we need to know is: 
Pitch Diameter = number of teeth/20
Gears always come in even increments, but you should check a COTS vendor to see what gears they provide. It should be under "20 DP gears" from West Coast Products, REV, or Andymark.

## Gearbox 2
This second gearbox introduces you to some more featurescripts as well as some basic design fundamentals. After finishing these projects, we can graduate to stage 2A. Try to copy this and what you can learn. Ask questions in the discord about things you aren't clear about.
