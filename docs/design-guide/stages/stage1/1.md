# Beginner Stage 1A 
Welcome to stage 1A! In this short stage you're learning the basic tools and how they work. Through these projects you will learn how to use some of basic tools, as well as some of the core parts in FRC and how they go together. The focus on this guide is primarily to familiarize yourself and build CAD skills within an FRC context. We'll try to explain how various parts throughout the process, but please use the discord if you have any questions!  


## Sketching & Part Design
If you have a bit of prior experience with using Onshape's tools, you can skip the learning courses and polish your sketching and part design using a few CADvent drawings. Otherwise, please do the learning courses first; they help set a very good foundation for an efficient workflow.

### Onshape Courses

[Introduction to Sketching Course](https://learn.onshape.com/courses/introduction-to-sketching)<br>
[Part Design Course](https://learn.onshape.com/courses/fundamentals-part-design-using-part-studios)

These learning courses can help both old and new designers learn a good workflow for sketching and part design, and don't take that long to finish.

### CADvent Part Gallery
After completing the learning courses its still best to practice before moving further. Here are a variety of parts you can model to practice your sketching and modeling skills.

    Feel free to ask for help in the beginner channels in the DDS Discord Server.

Good job learning part design! Itâ€™s now time to build on this knowledge with a more fundamental understanding of the FRC design workflow.

## Swerve Drivebase

We're starting with this project since it's the most commonly used drivetrain, as well as being simple to design. 

- Ignore bellypan, focus on just chassis extrudes + side layout sketching + basic assembly, should be a quick project

## Gearbox 1
This first gearbox introduces you to some basic ideas. By the end of this you should be able to design your first gearbox and be introduced to some of the tools used. 

- Use Kremer Gearbox

## Gearbox 2
This second gearbox introduces you to some more featurescripts as well as some basic design fundamentals. After finishing these projects, we can graduate to stage 2A
