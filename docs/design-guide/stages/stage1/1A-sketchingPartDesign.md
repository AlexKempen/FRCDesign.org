# 1A: Sketching & Part Design

<br>

Welcome to stage 1! Through these projects you will learn how to use some of basic tools, as well as some of the core parts in FRC and how they go together. The focus on this guide is primarily to familiarize yourself and build CAD skills within an FRC context. We'll try to explain how various parts throughout the process, but please use the discord if you have any questions!  

If you have a bit of prior experience with using Onshape's tools, you can skip the learning courses and polish your sketching and part design using a few CADvent drawings. Otherwise, please do the learning courses first; they help set a very good foundation for an efficient workflow.

## Onshape Courses

[Introduction to Sketching Course](https://learn.onshape.com/courses/introduction-to-sketching)<br>
[Part Design Course](https://learn.onshape.com/courses/fundamentals-part-design-using-part-studios)

These learning courses can help both old and new designers learn a good workflow for sketching and part design, and don't take that long to finish.

## CADvent Part Gallery
After completing the learning courses its still best to practice before moving further. Here are a variety of parts you can model to practice your sketching and modeling skills. 

!!! tip
    Feel free to ask for help in the beginner channels in the DDS Discord Server.

Good job learning part design! It’s now time to build on this knowledge with a more fundamental understanding of the FRC design workflow.

## Multi-Part Modeling Theory:

Now that you’ve modeled a single part and played around with sketches. We’ll be introducing a new concept. Multi-part part studios.

When designing in Onshape, you typically have 1 part studio for subassembly. We can’t do that yet, but the next couple of projects will slowly introduce you to this concept. 

Here is an example of one of the future projects that you’ll be working on. Notice how there are multiple parts inside of this one part studio, and how it “almost” looks like the completed product.
