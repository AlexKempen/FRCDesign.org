# FRC Design Guide and Curriculum

Welcome to the DDS design guide! This guide is in progress, so if you have difficulty understanding something, please give us feedback as soon as possible!

This design guide assumes you know about FRC and have gone through at least a season of FRC. As this guide develops, we hope to cover absolute beginners, but for now this helps keep the project a bit more feasible. We'll cover getting Onshape set up and all the various tools you need at first, then start working immediately on projects which help build your CAD skills while gradually introducing design principles.

Although heavily recommended to go through for now, the aim is to replace the [Onshape Learning Center](https://learn.onshape.com/). Eventually, you will be able to just go through this guide to become both proficient at using Onshape and at designing good robots for FRC.

Instead of covering random features and tools that you might not use in FRC, this curriculum focuses on using features and skills that would be beneficial to use in an FRC context. After the fundamentals for sketching and part design are learned, it focuses very heavily on guided projects, slowly becoming more open-ended.

Let's cover the beginner stages:

### [Stage 0](stages/stage0/0A-introductionToCAD.md)

Stage 0 is for people that haven't touched CAD or Onshape before. It includes an in-depth introduction to CAD to read or skim through, a walkthrough to setup your Onshape account and add the tools you need to continue with the curriculum, a guide on navigating Onshape and the difference between part studios and assemblies, and some basic CAD theory that will help develop a good mindset. After this stage you can move onto the next one and actually start learning and practicing your skills. 

### [Stage 1](stages/stage1/1A-sketchingPartDesign.md)

In this stage, you begin with learning the fundamentals of Onshape sketching and part design, then move onto guided projects (a swerve drivebase and two gearboxes) to teach you how to use tools, part studios, and assemblies in the context of FRC. We'll try to briefly cover all the fundamental FRC-specific tools that help speed up your workflow.


### [Stage 2](stages/stage2/2.md)

In stage 1B we continue to focus on covering more design skills and concepts while we practice our CAD skills. There will be less new CAD concepts introduced here while we introduce 1-2 design concepts per project. By the end of this stage you should be significantly more comfortable using Onshape as well as have an understanding of the parts required to design a robot and how they all go together. 


### [Stage 3](stages/stage3/3A-multidoc&MS.md)

You've finished the Stage 1B Projects and are comfortable with the tools required to design a robot. We're transitioning to focusing on the design aspects, with the introduction to Master Sketching and high level design practices and workflows.


### Stage 1D 

In stage 1D, we try to tackle the integration parts of design. In this stage, you're learning how basic mechanisms integrate together and are applying top-down design practices such as master sketching into the shooter and pick-and-place robot projects. By the end of these projects you should be comfortable with the CAD and design process and are ready to work on intermediate concepts


### [Stage 2, Intermediate Stage](stages/stage2/2.md)

In this stage, you should be focusing primarily on mastering the design fundamentals to the point where they are natural. At this point you can be working on more advanced mechanisms and robots for more ambitious projects, or working on your speed gains to design robots faster. With a good optimal workflow you should be able to design a high quality mechanism in under 12 hours from scratch. Aim for faster, but the idea is that by this stage, build season becomes a lot more comfortable if you aren't working overtime to cad.
