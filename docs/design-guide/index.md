# Introduction to Onshape and FRC Design (stage 0)

Welcome to the DDS design guide! This guide is in progress, so if you have difficulty understanding something, please give us feedback as soon as possible!

This design guide assumes you know about FRC and have gone through at least a season of FRC. As this guide develops, we hope to cover absolute beginners, but for now this helps keep the project a bit more feasible. We'll cover getting Onshape set up and all the various tools you need at first, then start working immediately on projects which help build your CAD skills while gradually introducing design principles.

Although heavily recommended to go through for now, the aim is to replace the Onshape Learning center in which you can just go through this guide to learn both Onshape and FRC design. 

Instead of covering random parts and tools that you might not use, everything here uses parts and skills that you'd immediately use in season.

 Let's cover the beginner stages:

### Stage 0

If you haven't touched Onshape before, you are in this stage. Luckily this stage is short. You just need to set up everything according to the guide and we can move onto stage 1A. 

### Stage 1A

In this stage, you begin to learn how to design your first robot parts and chassis. We'll try to cover FRC specific tools that you need to immediately start making things you can use for your robots. We'll try to briefly cover all the core fundamentals you need.


### Stage 1B

In stage 1B we continue to focus on covering more design skills and concepts while we practice our CAD skills. There will be less new CAD concepts introduced here while we introduce 1-2 design concepts per project. By the end of this stage you should be significantly more comfortable using Onshape as well as have an understanding of the parts required to design a robot and how they all go together. 


### Stage 1C

In stage 1C, we try to tackle the integration parts of design. There's only two, but rather large projects in 1C. A pick and place robot, and a shooter robot.
These robots are primarily focused around pick and place and shooter games. By the end of these projects you should be comfortable with the CAD and design process and are ready to work on intermediate concepts


### Stage 2, Intermediate Stage

In this stage, you should be focusing primarily on mastering the design fundamentals to the point where they are natural. At this point you can be working on more advanced mechanisms and robots for more ambitious projects, or working on your speed gains to design robots faster. With a good optimal workflow you should be able to design a high quality mechanism in under 12 hours from scratch. Aim for faster, but the idea is that by this stage, build season becomes a lot more comfortable if you aren't working overtime to cad.
