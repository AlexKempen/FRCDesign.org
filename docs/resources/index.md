# Resources
This section includes resources that you may find useful to help improve your knowledge of mechanisms, help you understand the rest of the site better, and assist your CAD workflow.

## Sections

### [Glossary](glossary.md)
The glossary is a compiled list of words (including acronyms and abbreviations) and definitions to help people understand the lingo used in various parts of the website and on the discord server. When you find one of these words across the site, it will be underlined, and you can hover over it to see the definition.

### [Mechanism Examples](../mechanism-examples/index.md)
A library of mechanisms is being continuously compiled in this section. The idea of each page is "quality over quantity", so we hope to provide "Behind the Design" for each mechanism example added, in order to explain insights into certain design decisions, and how they worked out if the robot ended up being built.

### CAD Resources
A collection of resources to support your workflow in Onshape, relevant to FRC.

[**Featurescripts**](featurescripts.md): A list of FRC-relevant featurescripts and how to add them (includes some short tutorial videos).

[**Simplified Models**](simplified.md): A collection of simplified models of COTS parts to reduce load time (see the importance of this in [assembly best practices](../design-standards/assembly-setup.md)). These are also already mostly added to [MKCAD](https://appstore.onshape.com/apps/Manufacturers%20Models/2ZT7X5D646R3LM3ZND7LGBTYRVM4SVH6CDDGM6I=/description).

[**Configurables**](configurables.md): A collection of configurable parts or assemblies that aren't in MKCAD that could assist your design.

[**KrayonCAD**](krayonCAD.md): A resource now integrated with MKCAD that allows people to quickly model out robot architectures.
