# CAD Best Practices: Why?

In this guide we will document CAD and FRC design best practices. Generally, measures such as these are taken for the following reasons:

Why structure CAD?

- Keep loading times low for your CAD
- Stay organized, so that making changes down the line is easier and more accessible
- Encourage top-down design through document structure
- Make CAD resistant to breaking

Why standardize design?

- Make it easier for new designers to succeed; reduce the number of things to learn
- Make it harder to make mistakes - encourage good practice through standardization
- Reduce part cost - only invest in parts that work and last

Essentially, standardizing practices on your FRC team helps to ease the requirement of institutional knowledge by making things "just work".
