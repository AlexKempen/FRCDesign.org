Effective Mastersketcing requires you to stay organized. This means:

- Multiple sketches, usually one per subsystem, within the Mastersketch part studio. Keep everything seperate!
- Name / color your sketches accordingly
- Start with a basic field mastersketch to build on
- Sketch all the possible states of each moving subsystem 

In general, mastersketching is an art that can require some practice to get the hang of. [This tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd_XzBw5V_U) can help you get started if you are unsure.
