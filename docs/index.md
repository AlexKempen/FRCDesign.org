# Welcome to FRCDesign.org
FRCDesign.org is a comprehensive learning guide and technical reference for FRC design using Onshape.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-book-open-variant:{ .lg .middle } __The Design Guide__

    Looking to learn Robot design? Don't know where to start? Start here. 

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Design Guide](design-guide)

-   :material-bookshelf:{ .lg .middle } __Design Fundamentals__

    ---

    Dives into the concepts necessary in order to design a competitive robot. Unlike the design guide, this is primarily a reference wiki.

-   :material-book:{ .lg .middle } __Mechanism Examples__

    ---

    Unlike other mechanism example collections, these are hand picked for specific concepts, with detailed breakdowns behind the design.

    We run weekly design challenges! (Think of them as mini Cadathons) Try them here.

## What is FRCDesign.org?

1. FRCDesign.org is not a resource collection. Everything here is written for the website, and checked to align our goals. 
2. We're competitive focused. Designing competitive robots helps inspire students, and this means that what we teach is from a competitive standpoint. At the same time, you'll still learn so much more about robot design compared to anywhere else. 
2. We don't try to teach everything. This website is built around a single CAD software (Onshape), and we encourage a specific design style which is optimized for the majority of mid-resource teams. 
3. We try to include the small details that most guides forget. Everyone knows what am "arm" is, but the concepts behind designing a pivot that works every match and never breaks? That's much more important.
4. Design practices are important! We try to document and teach the best practices possible so you can design faster during the season.  

## Discord
The most important part of the design process is getting feedback and learning from others. Join the Discord for design reviews, design challenges, and events.
