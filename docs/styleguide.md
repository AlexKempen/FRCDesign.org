# Style Guide

Don’t deal in absolutes.

- Only a Sith deals in absolutes
- Use pros/cons lists to compare options
- Explain WHY something is good or bad
  - For example, we all know neo550s are bad. But don’t just say they’re bad, say: “Neo 550 motors are underpowered and often burn in a few seconds under stall, which is why they are not generally recommended. We would highly recommend purchasing Neo or Kraken class motors being sold by REV and WCP instead”
  - Similarly, we know the Kraken motors are generally good. But explain why they are good, e.g. “We would recommend using Krakens on your drivetrain because they are extremely high torque motors and will improve your acceleration. In addition, they have integrated Talon FX motor controllers that make them easier to wire and feature a high resolution encoder which will help the precision of your swerve odometry. Keep in mind that Kraken motors are not yet compatible with stock REV Maxswerve modules and require an extra adaptor from WCP to mate with other existing modules.”
- Still emphasize that teams are free to explore and innovate, but help set realistic expectations (see the following point)

DDS Manual is a guide from a competitive standpoint.
- Try to leave out stuff that doesn’t work well and is unpopular; if it is popular it is worth explaining the disadvantages (See tank drive vs mechanum drive; explaining tank drive, as a relatively popular and simple drivetrain makes sense, but mecanum drive, a drivetrain that no longer makes sense in the era of swerve and has little-to-no pushing power or traction.)
- Try to leave opinions out as much as possible. Do not speak authoritatively on stuff you do not have first-hand experience with whenever possible

Keep in mind that FRC design trends are temporary and transient.
- Just because something is popular one season doesn’t mean it’s the end all be all. There was a time when WCD and sheet metal superstructures was all the rage, but that doesn’t mean that we should recommend them in DDS Guide. Try your best to think about why something is popular, and what benefits in design, function, and execution they actually bring to the table.

<!-- Adding examples of mechanisms really helps with knowledge transfer.

Credit the teams: Caption Format is: [Team Number] [Team Name], (Relevant Accomplishment), [Season], (description)

[]s mean all the time, ()s means when relevant

If you have multiple pictures by the same part from the same team only credit them on the last one to avoid repetition.

Examples

8417 ‘Lectric Legends, Rover Ruckus, TPU intake flaps

Adhere to brand standards when possible.

- Abide by FIRST® Trademark guidelines, available [here](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/UseofUSFIRSTandLEGOGroupTrademarksandCopyrightedMaterials.pdf)
- The first instance of *FIRST* and FTC on a page should include ® (i.e, FIRST®)
- Always capitalize and italize the name *FIRST*
- Do NOT use a possessive on the *FIRST* name (e.g, FIRST’s)
<!-- It’s gm0 not GM0 damn it; look at the logo. -->
- This also applies to team names: spell them how they are officially spelled
- Check [The Blue Alliance](thebluealliance.com) if you don't know how to spell a team's name

You can use “you” when writing, when it makes writing less awkward. However, try avoiding excessively using it.
