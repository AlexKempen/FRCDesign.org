# 1D: Subsystem Workflow - Detailing the Drivebase

## Introduction

In the past three sections, you've learned the fundamentals of modeling parts and power transmissions and learned the top-down design workflow. In Stage 1D, you will practice those modeling techniques by **adding the rest of the necessary components to the drivebase you began modeling in Stage 1C**. This will help you get comfortable with the typical workflow of a modeling an entire subsystem while keeping things simple.

### Subsystem Workflow
The typical workflow when modeling a subsystem involves the following:

1. Create the layout sketches in your layout sketch part studio
2. Derive the layout sketch into the part studio
3. Create the basic structure of your mechanism based on the master sketch (plates, tubes, etc.)
4. Insert the basic structure into the assembly, group, fasten to the origin, and finish creating the structure
5. Insert the assembly into the top-level robot assembly
6. Go back and add different components to finish detailing the subsystem.

### Project Overview

So far, you’ve done the master sketch and modeled the frame and bare bellypan.

**To finish the drivebase, you will use the content on the following pages to add these details:**

1. **Battery Mounting:** Every robot needs a battery, and while the location may vary based on the other mechanisms present in your robot, it should always be placed as low as possible to make the robot more stable.

2. **Electronics Mounting:** Adequate space must be allocated on the robot for ease of wiring. Typically, the robot’s electronics are mounted on the bellypan.

3. **Bellypan Pocketing:** This step is optional. Some teams will prefer to add cutouts in their bellypan to remove weight and make wiring easier. However, pocketing the bellypan may significantly increase machining time.

4. **Bumpers and Bumper Mounting:** While bumper rules can vary from year to year, they are almost always required to protect your robot and other robots from collisions. Making your bumpers easy to attach and remove is also a very nice quality of life improvement for when you’re at competition.

!!! Note
    Even though the first three details won't directly reference the layout sketch, they will reference parts that reference the layout sketch (the frame) and will update accordingly if changes are made.

While the exact implementation for each of these details will vary based on the rest of your robot and from team to team, an example reference for Stage 1D is provided.

!!! Tip
    As you should have a good grasp of part modeling by now, feel free to use your own team's preferences to add details to your drivebase. This can be very open ended.
