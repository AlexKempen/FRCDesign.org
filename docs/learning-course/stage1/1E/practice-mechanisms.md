# Practice Mechanisms
## Introduction

This is the final section of Stage 1. 
Before moving on to Stage 2 (where you will learn mechanism design and be introduced to a variety of COTS parts and concepts), you will need to complete some practice mechanisms to practice your CAD skills. 

For simplicity, these mechanisms will be modeled out-of-context of a full robot. 
For these exercises, don't think too hard about the design behind them. 
Instead, focus on refining your CAD techniques and following best practices such as fully constraining your sketches, modeling in a way that captures design intent, and naming your features and parts. 

As you progress, the level of guidance will gradually decrease. 
While you should reference the solutions document to ensure your model and modeling methods are correct, try to avoid *blindly* copying the model.

Each exercise should take no more than 40 to 45 minutes to complete.

<!-- The following is just notes that can be used in the final content of the page.

Remember, practice is essential â€“ the more CAD models you create, the more proficient and efficient you'll become. Using keyboard shortcuts can significantly accelerate your CAD workflow. Be attentive to best practices to avoid developing any bad habits.

These mechanisms will not be designed in the context of a robot and are purely for practicing relevant CAD skills for FRC, so an intelligent origin will not be used. It will be used again in stage 2 though because whole subsystems should always be designed in the context of a robot using a larger collection of layout sketches.

Though the mechanisms will not be designed in the context of a robot, maintaining good top-down design workflow and utilizing intelligent origins will be extremely useful still. Make sure to use layout sketches like the ones used for the gearboxes in 1B and the drivetrain in 1C to guide the design of the practice mechanisms. A layout sketch workflow will be useful no matter the scale, as you can define most of your important dimensions there, ready to be easily changed if needed. The origin of your part studio and assembly should be consistent as well. You can use the origin cube + insert/group/fastenToOrigin assembly insertion method to make things really easy.

In Stage 2, you will begin to model robot mechanisms using all the skills you have learned in Stage 0 and Stage 1! This will teach mechanism design, the purpose and correct usage of some COTS parts and power transmission techniques used in some of these practice mechanisms


Change this feedback form out and add one at the end of each section? Or do that but keep this one and edit the questions a bit and add one at the end of stage 2, since there's useful content here like the time it takes to complete it that we maybe wouldn't get from the smaller feedback forms? Idk I'll figure this out
Optionally, please fill out [this feedback form](https://forms.gle/J1QNvRkvpi7xyfuU8 "Learning Course Feedback Form"){:target="_blank"} about stages 0 and 1. -->
