# 1A: Onshape Fundamentals

Welcome to Stage 1! Here, you'll engage in a series of Onshape exercises and projects designed to introduce and develop your CAD skills within an FRC context. 

In Stage 1A, there are 3 major sections: sketching and part design, multi-part part studios, and assemblies. Each section has a link to a learning course to learn the skills of each topic, then an exercise to help immediately apply those skills in an FRC context. 

!!! Tip
    Remember to take a look at the [website feature guide](../../website-feature-guide.md "Website Feature Guide Page"){:target="_blank"} to gain an understanding of the different features used throughout the learning course!

### Learning Courses
[Onshape's Learning Center](https://learn.onshape.com/ "Onshape Learning Center"){:target="_blank"} provides free learning courses and articles covering everything from document navigation and sketching to advanced surface and sheet metal modeling. It's a valuable resource for both novice and seasoned users alike. We use a few selected courses to assist learning the fundamentals of doing CAD in Onshape, but the rest of the curriculum is project based.

The structure of the courses includes some short videos and practice models, expected time is 2-4 hours.

!!! Warning
    The Onshape learning courses are important as they will teach you the interface and form a basic foundation for CAD skills. Unless you have a significant amount of prior experience using Onshape, you should not skip the learning courses as the exercises assume that you have an understanding of CAD basics.
    
## Sketching and Part Design
Sketches and features are the building blocks you will use to create every 3D model in Onshape, so it's good to have a good grasp on the fundamentals.
### Learning Center Courses

**Complete the following Onshape Learning Courses:**

1. The [**Introduction to Sketching**](https://learn.onshape.com/courses/fundamentals-sketching "Introduction to Sketching Onshape Learning Course"){:target="_blank"} course runs you through different sketch tools, constraints, and a good sketch workflow.

2. The [**Part Design Using Part Studios**](https://learn.onshape.com/courses/fundamentals-part-design-using-part-studios "Part Design Using Part Studios Onshape Learning Course"){:target="_blank"} course runs you through creating different parts with a variety of features.

With a good understanding of both of these, you can create almost any part you want to. The following sections are all about integrating design intent into the process and learning how to design a whole project with multiple pieces.
