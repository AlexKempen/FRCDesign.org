# 0D: Theory

## Summary

Congratulations on completing Stage 0D! 

Here is a quick summary of the theory behind creating a part in feature-based CAD:

- Create a new sketch within a new part studio
- Define the sketch with constraints
- Transform the sketch into a 3D object with specified features
- Manipulate the part with additional features 
- Repeat these steps until the part is complete

Remember: One “part studio” can have multiple, even many different parts. We won’t focus on it for now, but keep it in mind!

Stage 0 has introduced the idea of CAD and why we use it in FRC, helped you set up an Onshape account, introduced the interface of Onshape, and introduced the fundamental theory of feature-based CAD. Now it's time to move on to Stage 1 where you'll start learning the software and doing exercises, practicing skills relevant to an FRC context. Good luck!
