# 2C: Dead Axle Pivot

## Friction

Friction must be minimized since the mechanism pivots around the axle. This can be done using either bushings or bearings. Bushings can handle higher loads at lower speeds, while bearings are more suited for higher speeds and lower loads, but larger bearings can be used for large dead axles.

### Reference Design

The reference design utilizes 7/8" ID bushings for the arm pivot to match the 7/8" OD tube axle. Bushings for 3/4" and 7/8" tube are commonly available with ODs of 1.125" to fit COTS sprockets. Bushings are generally well suited for applications with low speeds and high loads, such as arm pivots.
