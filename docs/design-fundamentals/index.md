# Design Fundamentals
This section will include fundamentals about FRC design and deep dives into how to make good mechanisms and things to take into account when designing.


## Fundamentals

### [Power Transmission](fundamentals/powerTransmission.md)
Covers motors and types of power transmission.

### Designing for Manufacturability
This section is all about designing with fabrication in mind. This means materials, hardware, tolerances, tools and machines, etc.

[**Materials**](fundamentals/materials.md): Different types of common materials in FRC and how to use them best, as well as a guide on lightening.

[**Hardware**](fundamentals/hardwareStandards.md): A guide on hardware and hardware standards common in FRC.

### [Designing for Controllability](fundamentals/DFC.md)
This page is about making your mechanisms and power transmission as easy to control as possible, including various ways to reduce backlash in systems.

## Mechanisms

### [Drivebase Fundamentals](mechanisms/drivebase.md/)
A guide on drivetrains, drivebase rigidity, wheelbase location, and electrical mounting.

**More mechanisms coming eventually**

## Design Write-ups
Write-ups on important topics for FRC design that aren't necessarily fundamentals but can take your design a step further.

### [Chain Tensioning Solutions](design-writeups/chainTensioning.md)
A number of different innovative ways to tension a chain to reduce backlash in a mechanism in a compact way.

### [Bumper Mounting Solutions](design-writeups/bumperMounting.md)
An overview of different bumper mounting solutions implemented by different teams or sold by different companies.
