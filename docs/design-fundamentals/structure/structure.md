How to use materials in different forms and various COTS pieces to create a robust and versatile structure system.

## Crush Blocks

Crush blocks pop up everywhere in modern frc design due to how frequently used fairly thin box tubing is. The main purpose of crush blocks is to prevent forces from buckling the thin wall of the tube. This is very easy to do by simply overtightening a bolt on the tube. While simply not overtorquing bolts will work, FRC teams are full of builders of various experience levels, and it is very easy to tighten too much, even for experienced builders.

    Crushblocks can be made of any material, but 3D printing them is by far the simplest method of manufacturing for crush blocks. Just make sure to account for printer tolerances. Crushblocks shouldnt be too loose, but you dont want to have to hammer them in.

Above is the most simple form of crushblock. Just a piece of plastic that fills the empty space within the tube with some holes for bolts to go through. For crushblocks specifically at the end of a tube you can include a flange to aide in alignment with the holes in the tube. Crush blocks may not be ideal for use in the middle of long tubes, since it would make
