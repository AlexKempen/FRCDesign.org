## Behind the design
This drivebase embodies all fundamentals of good drivebase design, including the following features:

___



### <p style="text-align: center;">Design for ***Rigidity*** </p>

|:-:|:-:|
|<figure>![2910 Top Down View](../../../img/cad-examples/drivebase/2910drivebase/2910topdown.webp){height=90% width=90%}</figure>| This drivebase is constructed primarily from 1/8 inch boxtube, with important cross-members providing rigidity to the structure. Drivebases must be built extremely tough, as they will experience the brunt of each collision while robots travel accross the field at high speed. The bellypan offers extra rigidity by holding the frame members prallel with each other.|

### <p style="text-align: center;">Design for ***Electrical*** </p>

Holes cut into aluminum may have sharp edges, so it's important to cover them with rubber grommets!</figcaption></figure>|<figure>![2910 Top Down View](../../../img/cad-examples/drivebase/2910drivebase/2910elec.webp){height=90% width=90%}<figcaption>The robot's bellypan should have mounting holes for most of the major electronics designed into it. This allows for easy and secure fastening of components like the PDH, and reduces the chances of electronics coming lose in competition.</figcaption></figure> |

<p style="text-align:center;">The drivebase usually serves a double purpose as a robot's electrical hub, so it's important to take electronics into consideration. While looking through the CAD, you may notice several key aspects of this drivebase that intentionally accomidate electronics including...</p>
- Pocketed bellypan serves a double purpose of both weight reduction, and providing many points to secure wires with zipties.
- All electronics have pre-designed mounting holes
- Holes in the frame-rails around the PDH allow for easy wire routing while keeping wires low in the bellypan and out of the way.
