|<figure>![2910 Top Down View](../../../img/cad-examples/drivebase/2910drivebase/2910topdown.webp){height=70% width=70%}</figure>| This drivebase is constructed primarily from 1/8 inch boxutbe, with important cross-members providing rigidity to the structure. Drivebases must be built extremely tough, as they will experience the brunt of each collision while robots travel accross the field at high speed. The bellypan offers extra rigidity by holding the frame members prallel with each other.|
